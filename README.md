- A simple AutoHotKey that inserts **all** possible / most **common**  Door/Landmine/Turret combinations ,that would disable them,
  into your terminal so you are able to help your friends in the dungeon much quicker! 
- It also contains Hotkeys for the "**view monitor**" command and for the "**switch**" command.
  
  ***Required Program***:

-**Controls are**:   
		- 0 (for inserting all combinations)

**Warning**:
This Script:
- may sometimes not work due to new updates of the game
- may be annoying and very loud due to the several inserts
- could be considered as cheating by some players
- Needs to be started seperately in case of interest in using

	- if its annoying and too loud try my other version that contains the most "**common**" combinations

Warning:
Helper like this:
- may sometimes not work after new updates of the game
- may be annoying and very loud due to the several inserts
- are somtimes considered as cheating 

	- if its annoying and too loud try my other version that contains the most COMMON combinations
	- if this doesnÂ´t work try out my other Versiob that contains the most COMMON combinations
